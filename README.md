# AI-Hand-Written-Digit-Recongnition
I took an AI course at Brown Univeristy Pre-College. The instructors were Justin Dong and the TA was Garret Warren. 
We used Keras and the hand written digit dataset from MNIST. The course also covered multi variable calculus so 
that we could Gradeint Descent as an optimization algorithm.
