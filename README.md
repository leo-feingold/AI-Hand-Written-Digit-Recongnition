# AI-Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
I took an AI course at Brown Univeristy Pre-College. The instructor was Justin Dong and the TA was Garret Warren. 
We used Keras and the hand written digit dataset from MNIST. The course also covered multi-variable calculus so 
that we could use Gradient Descent as an optimization algorithm. The final project was to correctly label the class 
of hand written digits.
